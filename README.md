💡 Overview:

Life changes dramatically when a baby arrives. Routines that once felt easy — exercising, eating well, sleeping — can suddenly fall apart as your energy and focus shift toward caring for your child. New parents often struggle to balance maintaining their own healthy habits while also tracking and managing all of a baby’s daily needs.
The Family Habit & Activity Tracker is designed to help bring order to that chaos. It’s a multi-profile habit and activity tracking app built with Vue.js and a backend database, allowing users to keep an eye on their personal goals and manage their baby’s essentials in one place. Adults can track their own habits like hydration, workouts, or sleep, while also logging baby-specific activities like feeding times, diaper changes, and milestones.
By combining habit tracking for adults with structured baby care logging, the app makes it easier for parents to maintain balance, stay healthy, and have all the data they need at their fingertips — whether for personal wellness or for sharing with a pediatrician.
