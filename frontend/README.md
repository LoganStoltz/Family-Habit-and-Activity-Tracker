# Family-Habit-and-Activity-Tracker
A habit/activity tracking web app that supports multiple profiles:  Adults can track their personal habits (drink water, exercise, meditate).  Parents can track their babyâ€™s routines (feeding, sleep, bathroom, milestones).  All logs will be stored, visualized, and analyzed with charts and streaks.

this will be using AWS for the backend, SQL for the database, and Vue.js as the framework to streamline the development process.


```sh
npm run test:unit
